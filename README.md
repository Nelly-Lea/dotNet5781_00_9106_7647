## Description
This application serves as a bus management system with two distinct interfaces: one for passengers and another for bus company to manage the bus line system. 

**Passenger Interface:**
- Enables travelers to explore routes (i.e., bus stations) based on selected departure and arrival stations. The system provides information on available buses along the chosen route.
- Features a simulator mimicking electronic bus display boards. Users can select a departure time, starting station, and a speed factor (representing the time speed). The simulator displays relevant bus lines, their final destinations, and the estimated wait times which decrease according to the chosen speed.

**Company Operations Interface:**
- Enables the bus company to manage bus lines with functions such as adding, removing, updating, and incorporating bus stations or entire bus lines.

## Goals and Features of this Project
- Exercise and apply principles of the C# programming language.
- Implement design patterns.
- Create a user interface using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).
- Utilize a three-layered architecture model (Presentation Layer, Business Logic Layer, Data Access Layer).
- Implement a Data Access Layer (DAL) to store data in XML files.
